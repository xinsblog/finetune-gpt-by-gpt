What did the author write before college?,"The author wrote stories and poetry before college. Specifically, he wrote a novella and a book of poems during his high school years.    "
What was the author's experience with the IBM 1401?,"The author's experience with the IBM 1401 began when he was a high school student working part-time at the Computer Center Corporation (CCC) in New York City. He was hired to write programs for the IBM 1401, which was a popular computer at the time. The author describes the IBM 1401 as a ""wonderful machine"" that was easy to program and reliable. He worked with the IBM 1401 for several years and gained valuable experience in computer programming that would later influence his career.    "
What programming language did the author use with the IBM 1401?,The author used assembly language with the IBM 1401.    
How did the author feel when they saw their friend typing programs into their microcomputer?,The author felt a mixture of surprise and excitement when they saw their friend typing programs into their microcomputer. They were surprised because they had never seen a microcomputer before and excited because they realized that this technology would change the way people used computers.    
What type of computer did the author's father buy?,The author's father bought an Altair 8800 computer.
What did the author write using the TRS-80 computer?,The author wrote a chess program using the TRS-80 computer.
What did the author plan to study in college?,The author planned to study physics and mathematics in college.
What did the author discover when they started college?,The author discovered that their interests had shifted towards mathematics and physics and that they no longer wanted to study engineering.
What were the two things that inspired the author to work on AI?,"The author was inspired to work on AI by two things: a conversation with a friend about the brain and the book ""Perceptrons"" by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert."
What was the name of the computer in Heinlein's novel?,"The name of the computer in Heinlein's novel was ""Mike."""
What was the name of the programming language commonly used at Cornell?,The programming language commonly used at Cornell mentioned in the text is called PL/I.
How did learning Lisp expand the author's concept of a program?,"Learning Lisp expanded the author's concept of a program by showing them that a program could be more than just a sequence of instructions executed by a computer. Lisp introduced the idea of a program as a data structure that could be manipulated and transformed, opening up new possibilities for programming and artificial intelligence. With Lisp, the author learned to think about programs in terms of symbolic expressions, rather than just lines of code, and to create programs that could manipulate and reason about symbolic representations of knowledge. This approach to programming and AI, known as symbolic or rule-based AI, was a major influence on the author's work in the field."
When did the author start to have a sense of where the new limits were?,The author started to have a sense of where the new limits were when they started working on the Macintosh project at Apple in the early 1980s.
Were there any AI classes at Cornell when the author started teaching themselves?,The author mentions that there were no AI classes offered at Cornell when they started teaching themselves about AI in the early 1980s.
What was the only form of input to programs on the IBM 1401?,The only form of input to programs on the IBM 1401 was punched cards.
What was the result of loading a program into memory and running it on the IBM 1401?,"When a program was loaded into memory and run on the IBM 1401, it would read in input data from punched cards or magnetic tape, process the data according to the instructions in the program, and write out the output data to punched cards or magnetic tape."
What was the author's clearest memory of working with the IBM 1401?,"The author's clearest memory of working with the IBM 1401 was of a debugging session that lasted until the early hours of the morning. They were working on a program that involved sorting and merging data, but it wasn't working correctly. The author was getting more and more frustrated as they tried to figure out what was going wrong, and at one point they kicked the machine in frustration. Suddenly, the program started working correctly. The author realized that they had probably dislodged a loose connection inside the machine when they kicked it, and this had fixed the problem. This experience taught the author the importance of perseverance and also gave them a deep respect for the complexity and fragility of computer systems."
What did the author's father use the word processor for?,The author's father used the word processor for writing his books.
How did the author feel about their experience learning Lisp?,"The author felt that learning Lisp was a transformative experience that expanded their understanding of programming and what a program could be. They described it as ""intellectual dynamite,"" and it changed the way they thought about programming and the possibilities of what could be achieved with it."
